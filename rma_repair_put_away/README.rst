===================
RMA Repair Put Away
===================

Glue module between rma_repair & rma_put_away
    
When not using rma_put_away you can define push rules anyway to move the products
to the repair location, and those transfers count as rma repair transfers

If you install and use rma_put_away then the rma repair transfers are the ones
from the putaway moves
